** TODO 2-73 and corresponding check why ** x y 'x dont work
** TODO 2-74
** TODO 2-81 I don't get it, ppl say that invoking exp for 2 complex numbers will result
in infinite loop where in my implementation it correctly reports that no such procedure
is found for this types.

** TODO 2-82 Find a case when find-right-coercion procedure fails is not working

** TODO In 2-87 I introduced some changes to drop, hierarchy procedures,
which might have been introduced earlier. Purpose of these changes is to be able to handle
types that are not part of the central type tower.

** TODO get back finish 2-90 > till section 3
