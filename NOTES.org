* SICP Notes

Notes mostly to myself to go back to some exercises and do something.

** TODO 2-49 add a wave definition
** TODO 2-51 add a second beside def based on transformations
** TODO 2-52 complete
** 2-58-b
** TODO 2-64 add a comment how partial tree procedure works
** TODO 2-73 and corresponding check why ** x y 'x dont work
** TODO 2-74
** TODO 2-81 I don't get it, ppl say that invoking exp for 2 complex numbers will result
in infinite loop where in my implementation it correctly reports that no such procedure
is found for this types.

** TODO 2-82 Find a case when find-right-coercion procedure fails is not working
** TODO 2-86 modify mul, div (requires sqrt to be implemented for generic)
